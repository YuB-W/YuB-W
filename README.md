# üí´ About Me

I'm a 19-year-old self-taught security enthusiast with a deep passion for technology, hacking, and development. Over the past year, I‚Äôve expanded my knowledge and experience, diving deeper into RF hacking, and I‚Äôve started new projects centered around **HackRF One** and **RTL-SDR**. These tools have enabled me to develop advanced skills in **RF spoofing**, **jamming**, and **attack detection**.

In addition to my previous experience in network security and penetration testing, I now specialize in leveraging **radio frequencies** for a variety of cybersecurity applications, from attack simulation to RF signal analysis. I enjoy creating innovative solutions that combine my technical knowledge with my drive for automation and simplicity.
